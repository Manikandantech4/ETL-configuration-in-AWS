# ETL-configuration-in-AWS
This project demonstrates the creation of a fully serverless ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using AWS services. Raw data stored in Amazon S3 is processed using AWS Glue Studio and queried using Amazon Athena, enabling efficient data analysis without managing any infrastructure.

Goal:
Build a simple ETL pipeline that:
1. Takes raw data from Amazon S3
2. Cleans/transforms it using AWS Glue Studio
3. Saves the processed data back to S3
4. Queries it using AWS Athena
